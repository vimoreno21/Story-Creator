# Story-Creator
Pointer, Arrays, and Files Project (in C)

      In this project, I created random stories using .txt files of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and prepositions. These stories made no sense, but were grammatically correct. An everyday equivalence to this would be a Mad Libs story. Some challenges with this project were mallocing and freeing space being used, using pointer efficiently, and attaining the words from the .txt files correctly.
